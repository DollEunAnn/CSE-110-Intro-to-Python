# I added way where i can count how many times does the user entered an invalid option. If it reaches to 3, the game will automatically ends.
# At the same time, to help me warn the user I made a function - invalid_input_notif()

# My sister played the game and her feedback was, she doesn't know the first time that she need to choose between the capitalize letters
# so I ended up putting an instructions before the start of the game. When my mother played this time, she keeps putting space accidentally so I also
# included a strip() function. They said it was fun and I also happy that they enjoyed it.
